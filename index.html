                    <h2>What do you want to learn in this course?</h2>
                    <p>I'd love to learn as much as I can about HTML and CSS skills since I had absolutely no experience of coding before. If possible, I would love to work with my classmates on a website together!! </p>

                    <h2>Tell us about an early experience with computers or the internet</h2>
                    <p>When I was 8, there was a very popular online game for children called Mole's World. You played as a Mole and lived in this fairy-tale-like world. There were so many things to do: Picking fruits in a forest, taking part-time jobs as a chef, a cop or a firefighter, and buying costumes at a fashion store... It lighted up my childhood. </p>

                    <h2>What will the web look like in 10 years from now?</h2>
                    <p>In 10 years, I believe the design style of web page would be more precise. Designers would take away elements that are not mandatory and only leave the necessary message, but they would definitely make sure the web looks good. I can tell that in 10 years, web could be even more interactive with the users.</p>

                    <o>Flora's thought about how website will look in 10 yaers is very interesting. Maybe in 10 years, we can literally "touch" the websites, and "dive into" the internet.</o>
